# tests if path to self has a weight of 0.000
created graph graph
added node n1 to graph
path from n1 to n1:
total cost: 0.000
added node n2 to graph
added edge 0.000 from n1 to n2 in graph
path from n1 to n1:
total cost: 0.000
added node n3 to graph
added edge 1.000 from n1 to n3 in graph
path from n1 to n1:
total cost: 0.000
